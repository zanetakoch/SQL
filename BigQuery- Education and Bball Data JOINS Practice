--Numbers 1-4 will use the World Bank’s International Education Dataset in BigQuery.


--1. Education table_1 has 100 rows and table_2 has 10 rows, and they share 10 keys in common.

--Using INNER JOIN --> get 10 rows in results.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.key = table_2.key;

--Using LEFT JOIN --> get 100 rows in results.
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2
ON table_1.key = table_2.key;


--2. Pull information from both the international_education and country_summary tables by joining the tables on the country_code foreign key, and returning the country name, country code, and value column. 
SELECT `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.country_name, 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary`.country_code, 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.value
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` 
ON `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary`.country_code = `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.country_code;


--3. Use descriptive aliases to improve readability.
SELECT edu.country_name,
    summary.country_code,
    edu.value
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education` AS edu
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` AS summary
ON edu.country_code = summary.country_code;


--4. Answer the question: What is the average amount of money spent per region on education? 
SELECT AVG(edu.value) average_value, summary.region
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education` AS edu
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` AS summary
ON edu.country_code = summary.country_code
WHERE summary.region IS NOT null
GROUP BY summary.region
ORDER BY average_value DESC;



--5. Provide data for a feature sports article on Michael Jordan’s basketball career. Find out if Michael Jordan played better at schools with animal mascots. 
--To analyze his early career, start with the years he played basketball in college by examining National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college basketball stats from 1984. 
--Find a list of all NCAA Division I colleges and universities; their mascots, if applicable; and their number of wins and losses in the public dataset ncaa_basketball on BigQuery.
--I joined the season statistics from one table with the mascot information from another using a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN, because not all teams have mascots. If I used an INNER JOIN, I would exclude teams with no mascot.
SELECT seasons.market AS university,
 seasons.name AS team_name,
 seasons.wins,
 seasons.losses,
 seasons.ties,
 mascots.mascot AS team_mascot
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS seasons
LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mascots` AS mascots
ON seasons.team_id = mascots.id
WHERE seasons.season = 1984
 AND seasons.division = 1
ORDER BY seasons.market;
